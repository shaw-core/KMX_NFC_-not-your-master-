# Description for "NFC Audio Player Project(kmx-nfc-notYourMaster)"
This project enables automatic audio playback through NFC-triggered web pages. By scanning an NFC tag, users are redirected via an intermediate HTML page to the main page where the audio file kmx_not_your_master.mp3 is played. This approach successfully circumvents browser restrictions on autoplay triggered by NFC. The project demonstrates effective use of NFC technology in web development, providing a seamless and interactive user experience.
